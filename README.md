#MP3 Playground
##Enjoy and share your favorite music!


###This app is inspired by the classic media player 'Winamp', which is a simple yet powerfully efficient means to intereact with a collection of music files.

###Because of its simplicity, Winamp was also best used with smaller catalogues, as opposed to larger, more comprehensive collections.

###Winamp also incorporated features such as music visualization which greatly enhanced the listening experience.  I would like to try to recreate this feature using D3.js.

###I would like this project to be an opportunity to gain experience with the MEAN stack, and learn to work with hosting files while using MongoDB.
