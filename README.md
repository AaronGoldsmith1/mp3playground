#MP3 Playground
##Enjoy and share your favorite music!


###This app is inspired by the classic media player 'Winamp', which is a simple yet powerfully efficient means to intereact with a collection of music files.

###Because of its simplicity, Winamp was also best used with smaller catalogues, as opposed to larger, more comprehensive collections.

###I would like this project to be an opportunity to learn to work with hosting files while working with MongoDB.
